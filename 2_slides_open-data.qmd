## Overview of the session

\

1. **Introduction to 3 open science aspects (10min each)**
   - Preregistration & Registered Reports
   - Open and FAIR data
   - Open and Reproducible Code<br /><br />

## Examples of good practices

::: {.panel-tabset .smaller09}

### Findable

**The problem:**  
Just because we provide data online, doesn't mean that others will find it.  
  
We could have the greatest data set to answer further research questions - if our colleagues don't know it exists or can't locate the data, openness will be of little value.
  

**The solutions:**

* Get a persistent identifier (e.g., DOI), where you provided your data
  - search for a research data center that fits your needs: [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/)
  - recommended research data centers: [Verbund FDB (education, Germany)](https://www.forschungsdaten-bildung.de/), [RDC at ZPID (psychology, Germany)](https://rdc-psychology.org/), ...
  - recommended repositories: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [psycharchives.org](https://www.psycharchives.org/), [osf.io](https://osf.io/), ... 
* Mention DOI in publication that builds on this data (e.g., in the "data accessibility statement")
* Describe your data as richly as possible (metadata). *Research data centers* offer form fields tailored to the discipline or data type. With *repositories* use alternative possibilities, such as keyword fields.
  - e.g., which variables does the quantitative data set contain?
  - e.g., which topics does your data cover?
  - e.g., which population did you draw your sample from?

### Accessible

**The problem:**  
Just because others find our data doesn't mean the *access barriers* are as low as possible and doesn't mean they know *in which way* they are allowed to access it. Examples:

* Providing a link to the data in the text of a paywalled journal article
* Unclear licensing / use conditions when providing data (e.g., are non-researchers allowed to access the data or is it only open for qualified researchers?)

**The solutions:**

* Make sure access is free of charge (or as cheap as possible)
  - e.g., by providing link to data in publicly accessible sections of journal articles that are not open access
  - e.g., by using repositories or research data centers that allow access free of charge
* Make sure users know if they can access and under which conditions
  - e.g., *research data centers* ensure that terms of use are clear (who may access under what conditions) and offer different levels of access restriction
  - e.g., on *repositories* provide a readme-file and an open license (e.g., [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/), [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.de), [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.de)) with data sets for access cases


### Interoperable

**The problem:**  
Just because others downloaded our data doesn't mean they can open and manipulate it.

**The solutions:**  

* Use file formats with open licenses
  - e.g., tabular data: CSV (with additional labelling script), RData
  - e.g., text data: PDF, HTML, ODT, RTF
* Make sure users know how different files are related to one another
  - e.g., define which file contains student data and which teacher data
  - e.g., define which file contains data from cohort 1 and which cohort 2, ...

### Reusable

**The problem:**  
Just because others opened our data doesn't mean they understand the data and its use-conditions. Examples:

* Others can't understand what the column names of the tabular data set mean: Which columns in the data set relate to which variables in the journal article?
* Can someone from sociology use the data set from psychology they found on osf.io?
* Does someone reusing a data set have to cite the authors?

**The solutions:**  

* Adhere to standards in folder organization
  - e.g., [PSYCH-DS](https://psych-ds.github.io/) (see technical specification draft)
* Rich description/explanation of what user will find *in* the data set (≠ meta descriptions about the data set *as a whole*, as for accessibility)
  - e.g., provide a codebook. How to semi-automatically create a codebook, see the R package [`codebook`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/codebook/readme/README.html)
* Provide a license for the use-cases
  - again, *research data centers* ensure that terms of use are clear (who may use under what conditions)
  - again, on *repositories* provide a readme-file and an open license (e.g., [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/), [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.de), [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.de)) with data sets for the use-cases

## Examples of good practices

### tldr;

*What typical data sharing might look like:*

```{r}
fair_tbl <- data.frame(ToDo = c("<b>describe</b> what's in the data", "<b>share</b> via repository/ research data center (rdc) <br />that offers DOI", "<b>connect</b> DOI with paper"),
                       `Tools/Options` = c("<b>quantitative:</b> Create codebook via <a href='https://rubenarslan.github.io/codebook/articles/codebook_tutorial.html'>codebook R package</a><br /><b>qualitative:</b> provide methods and/or field report",
                                           "&#127466;&#127482; <a href='https://zenodo.org/'>Zenodo</a> (repository; option: visibility restricted)<br />&#127482;&#127480; <a href='https://osf.io/'>OSF</a> (repository; option: project private)<br />&#127482;&#127480; <a href='https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/'>Open ICPSR</a> (rdc)<br />&#127468;&#127463; <a href='https://www.data-archive.ac.uk/'>UK Data Archive</a> (rdc)<br />&#127465;&#127466; <a href='https://www.forschungsdaten-bildung.de/'>VerbundFDB</a> (rdc)",
                                           "put in section 'data availability', 'open practices', <br />'supplemental material', ..."))

fair_tbl %>%
  kbl(escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_material(c("striped"))
```



## Examples of good practices

* Example of publication with **FAIR open data**: 
   - paper: <https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.230595> (link to data in section "Data accessibility")
   - open data: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7886776>
   - codebook in same repo<br /><br />
* Example of publication with **synthetic FAIR data**: 
   - paper: <https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-023-09460-4> (link to data in section "Data Availability")
   - synthetic data: <https://osf.io/qkr9a/>
   - codebook: <https://osf.io/wced4><br /><br />
* Example of publication with synthetic **FAIR data with restricted access**: 
   - paper: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2024.105542> (link to data in section "Transparency and openness")
   - restricted data: <https://doi.org/10.7802/2330> (curated at a research data center)
   - codebook available after login
