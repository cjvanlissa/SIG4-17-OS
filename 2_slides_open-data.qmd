## Overview of the session

\

1. **Introduction to 3 open science aspects (10min each)**
   - Preregistration & Registered Reports
   - Open and FAIR data
   - Open and Reproducible Code<br /><br />
2. **Subgroup Discussions (60min)**
   - One group for each OS aspect
   - Applying a model for managing complex change"
   - For each OS aspect: Where do you see the greatest need for change?
   - What specific actions can we take or initiate?<br /><br />
3. **Bringing Ideas Together, Plenary Discussion (30min)**


## What is open and FAIR data

* Description and Definition: Explain what the open science practice is, including its key concepts and terminology.

## Potential impact and benefits

* Potential for Advancing Research: Discuss how this practice can enhance research in learning and instruction. If there is evidence from empirical studies, here would be a good spot to put it.
* Broader Implications: Explore how the practice might influence the research community.

## Examples of best practices

* Successful Implementations: Provide examples of how this practice has been effectively applied in other research settings or fields.
* Highlight best practices, and any tools or resources that have facilitated successful adoption.


## Introduction of Subgroup Discussions

* Short introduction to Model for Managing Complex Change (Lippitt-Knoster)
* Explanation of how we document the outcomes of subgroup discussions
